<p>It is basically the same thing as the russian squat program except on the first and third day of the week you will do front squats and in the second day you will backsquat. If i front squat without heeled shoes i am guaranteed back pain for a week. It's not so much a relief from any pain or stress as it is a bonus to comfort, stability and the way the lift feels.
