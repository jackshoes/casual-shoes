<p>It’s even a great pick for new runners who are just getting their feet wet (no pun intended)! Following a more sustainable design approach, this shoe also uses fewer resources to colour the sockliner. I thought i would wear them around the house before committing to them to see how comfortable they are to wear for any length of time. Whenever i walk into a running store and look at a shoe the first thing i do is fold the shoe like a taco.</p>
