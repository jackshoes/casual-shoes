4.5 out of 5 stars. Rated 1 out of 5 by respectfully disappointed from quality not there anymore i have worn asics gt 1000 and 2000 series shoes since 2006 when i started running marathons and after being evaluated and fitted at my local running store. I pick up a pair when i find a sale price and store them away for future use. I have weak ankles, and these shoes are excellent at stabilizing them.
