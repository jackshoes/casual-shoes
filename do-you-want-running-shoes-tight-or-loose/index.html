Do you know why your shoelaces often come loose? From inuth.com
People think they need to be tight, they need to be laced tight, they need to be super snug. A tighter fit means you’ll stay more connected to your trainers as you begin to pick up the pace, so if speed is the name of your game, you might want to forgo wiggle room in favor of a more snug fit. Go for a run in them if you can. When you are trying out a shoe, make sure you are able to fit your foot in quite easily but not too easy.
