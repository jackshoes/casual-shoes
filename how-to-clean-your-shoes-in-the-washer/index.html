How to Clean Your Slip Resistant Shoes Get a Grip! From srmax.com
It’s a fairly straightforward process, but care should be taken. Instead, clean fabric shoe surfaces by hand with just some dishwashing detergent, warm water, an old toothbrush, and paper towels. Drying wet shoes never put wet shoes in a clothes dryer or near a heat source—this includes anything that would force dry your shoes like a radiator, tumble dryer, fireplace, hairdryer or any other source of direct heat. Simply scrub the shoes using the solution and a toothbrush, then wipe them off with a paper towel to dry.
