This reduces the life of machine parts, tyres and shoe soles. We need more friction to walk easily. You can measure the friction for various types and sizes of shoes with equipment or estimate it by using a board at an incline. The results showed that tread groove depth affected the friction coefficients significantly.

<p>Fluid friction doesn't sound like something that would have to do with basketball, but it does. The friction temperature distribution is obtained by a fourier transform technique. The more static friction you have, the more grip on your shoes you have. The force of static friction is a force between two surfaces that prevents those surfaces from sliding or slipping across each other. Shoe friction experiment Casa Bouquet.</p>
