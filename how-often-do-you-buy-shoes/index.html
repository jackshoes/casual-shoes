<p>What kinds of shoes do you usually buy (or, prefer to buy)? I buy shoes once within three months that i wear regularly, and i also buy a pair of shoes for a special function according to my dress. I've bought many pairs of shoes directly from the retailer, or on amazon, as they have all sizes, newest models and really great prices. I’m trying to save up for a new car right now, so i don’t like to spend too much unnecessary money.</p>
