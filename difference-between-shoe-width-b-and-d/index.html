There is a difference between widths b and d and 3/8 difference between widths 4e and 6e.

It is important to note that this is the maximum difference in width and occurs around the ball of the foot. However, we’d advise against opting for a larger shoe size, solely for the purpose of getting a wider fit, as this could cause a trip hazard.
