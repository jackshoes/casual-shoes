Anyhow, if you do not start playing with your shoes and if you know when to wear it, you can prevent it from getting dirty. Remember, regardless of what you wear, an outfit is only as dressy as it&#39;s most casual piece. Shorter guys can wear whatever shoes they want, so try to focus on choosing shoes that feel good and match your outfit. For more formal occasions, look at pairing your white suit with either a pale blue cotton shirt or, alternatively, a contrasting indigo or khaki shirt.
