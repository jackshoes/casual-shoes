Anyhow, if you do not start playing with your shoes and if you know when to wear it, you can prevent it from getting dirty. Remember, regardless of what you wear, an outfit is only as dressy as it&#39;s most casual piece.

For more formal occasions, look at pairing your white suit with either a pale blue cotton shirt or, alternatively, a contrasting indigo or khaki shirt.
