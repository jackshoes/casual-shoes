adidas Box Hog 3 Plus Boxing Shoes From boxing914.com
The speed of a boxer’s feet compensates for weaker punches that are thrown, by being able to move around the target and land multiple punches with the opponent not being able to properly defend themself. I got the box hogs and even ordered them a size larger than normal, and they were so still so narrow that the tongue of the shoe didn&#39;t even cover the top of my foot. Not just my opinion, bunch of guys from the gym got same shoes. But what about the fit?
